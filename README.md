# What this Project About

An File Explorer In Terminal 

#  Motivation

the plan is use terminal to the max usage possible, like can i use everything in terminal. so that's the this idea came from a simple file explorer to look up file and directory in the current directory location and of course some basic utility like find file and open file.

# Future Me Todo

- Add Preview if its text related file (but it became beyond simple file explorer, but need to think about it)
- Add Filter (like filter extension file)
