# What this Project About

A Search File In Terminal 

#  Motivation

Well Search In Windows Explorer is Kind Annoying and never get any result because how limited the filter options are so and plus its quite slow because it's try to search the whole thing, why not i build it myself the plan is to use GUI be its kind annoying to build in GUI so i build in TUI because i just to do quick search and be done with it. no need to open a whole windows just to find one file, its like finding needle in the haystack and opening windows it just make me more distracted.

Well i wanna try to build like command like grep in linux for windows but thats for future me to do.
